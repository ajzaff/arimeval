The mc Perl script counts the number of moves possible
from a given Arimaa game position.  The game position
is specified using the 'Notation for Recording
Arimaa Positions' as defined in the Official Rules
and Notation section on the Arimaa site.
  http://arimaa.com/arimaa/learn/notation.html

To run the script just type 'mc' and it will
prompt for the name of the input file.

To run the script in batch mode type:
  mc inputFile > outputFile

Same as above but list only the positions:
  mc inputFile p > outputFile

Same as above but list only the moves:
  mc inputFile m > outputFile

Some sample input files are provided.
